There‚Äôs a reason cell rhymes with hell. On October 1	God is in His heaven	the stock market stands at 10	140	most of the planes are on time	and Clayton Riddell	an artist from Maine	is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He‚Äôs just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He‚Äôs already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife	and he knows just what he‚Äôll get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay‚Äôs feeling good about the future. That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse	and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone‚Äôs cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization‚Äôs darkest age	surrounded by chaos	carnage	and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve. There‚Äôs really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay	an arrow points home to Maine	and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise	perhaps. Or a threat... There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn‚Äôt have one?

In this brilliantly conceived tour de force	Stephen King‚Äîwho has absorbed the social	political	and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer‚Äîtakes readers on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. It begins with Jake Epping	a thirty-five-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls	Maine	who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives	and one essay blows him away‚Äîa gruesome	harrowing story about the night more than fifty years ago when Harry Dunning‚Äôs father came home and killed his mother	his sister	and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake	his life‚Äîlike Harry‚Äôs	like America‚Äôs in 1963‚Äîturning on a dime. Not much later his friend Al	who owns the local diner	divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past	a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession‚Äîto prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake‚Äôs new life as George Amberson	in a different world of Ike and JFK and Elvis	of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry	Maine (where there‚Äôs Dunning business to conduct)	to the warmhearted small town of Jodie	Texas	where Jake falls dangerously in love	every turn is leading eventually	of course	to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas	where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful	and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable. Or so terrifying.'
